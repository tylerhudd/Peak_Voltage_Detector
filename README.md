# Peak Voltage Detector for ATmega328P

This is a simple program for detecting and storing the highest voltage level of a signal across a pin of the ATmega328P.

## Description
This program was made as an intermediate component of my senior design project.  The project requires finding the peak voltage level of a signal to determine the amount of light emitted by a liquid.
